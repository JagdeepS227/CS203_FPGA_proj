2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell an_reg[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) an_reg[0]/CLR, an_reg[1]/CLR, an_reg[2]/CLR, an_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
